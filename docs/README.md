# The Thriving 5

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a cloned repository of my [COSC481W Senior Capstone Project](https://github.com/COSC481W-2021Fall/capstone-thriving-5), 'Help Hero'. Collaborated on a team of five members to design and develop an Android app that provides support and assistance to users suffering from mental health issues.

## Project summary

### Help Hero

A mobile app which will aim to help those suffering from a mental health crisis and will hopefully help to prevent a suicide. The app would provide information to licensed counselors, 24/7 hotlines, and emergency services.
There would also be a feature showing nearby events supporting suicide prevention, links to donate to mental health causes, and ways someone can help. There would be a database for licensed professionals who are willing to volunteer their time for remote meetings with someone in immediate distress. If there are no licensed counselors nearby in the app and it is an emergency, a series of questions will help someone to determine which hotline is best to call, or which hospital they can admit themselves into for the time being. A user database should have the option to create an account to schedule free remote counselling. Their account should also allow them to enter an emergency contact; A friend or family member who they can call/text. The app would also recommend calling their emergency contact as well as hotlines. A possible feature of this to be implemented could be the option for a user to send a predefined text or notification to their emergency contact.

## Code Review Guidlines

- Link it to an issue.
- Have at least one other person in the group look over code and bug or possible improvments before any commits or offical changes are made.
- This will need to be done more often than our twice aweek meeting so you'll need ask someone to meet with you for code review on your own time.
